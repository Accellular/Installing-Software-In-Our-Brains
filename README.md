# Installing Software In Our Brains
The most effective way to learn knowledge on your own.


## Script and Interpreter
Programmers generally know that Python scripts can be interpreted(executed) with python.exe.

For our brain, the knowledge and skills stored in the brain or recorded in books and other media are exactly the same as Python scripts. 

So what is the thing in the brain that corresponds to python.exe? 

The brain itself? Absolutely not.

The brain itself is a hardware like a computer, whereas python.exe is a software.
So we need a "software" in our brain to interpret this knowledge and skills codes.



## How do we "install" the software in our brain?
It must be emphasized that simply memorizing the contents of these recorded knowledge and skills is just copying them into the brain, not installing an executable software.

What people without programming experience may not know is that there is no essential difference in the storage method and format between so-called executable files, such as python.exe, and so-called text files, such as my_secret.txt. 

They are all sequences of a certain length of binary digits (1s and 0s) in a specific order. The main difference is how the hardware and operating system treat their structure and content.
If the structure and content of a sequence conform to the requirements of a particular hardware or operating system, it is considered executable.
Similarly, if we want to install a software that can execute knowledge or skills in our brain, simply memorizing the knowledge and skills is not enough, because it does not meet the brain's requirement for "executability".

Here comes the point, but since this is a tutorial for everyone, I will not explain the principles in detail here to avoid overloading unnecessary information or deviating from the goal. 

Information is stored in the brain based on the connection between nerve cells (that is, synapses). Whether it is memorizing knowledge or installing an executable software in the brain, it is necessary to reshape the connection between brain nerve cells, and it is a reshaping between a large number of cells.

The specific operation method is to use a set of similar "input information and corresponding output information" to iteratively stimulate the brain.

For example, if we want to learn a new language, in this example we choose to learn Japanese reading (because it is easy and fun), but why emphasize "reading"? This is very important, we will explain it later. 

The first step is to prepare a set of similar information:
```
• 畑に豚がいる。             (Meaning: There are pigs in the field.)
• 畑に猪がいる。             (Meaning: There are wild boars in the field.)
• 畑に牛がいる。             (Meaning: There are cows in the field.）
• 畑に鶏がいる。             (Meaning: There are chickens in the field.)
• 畑に羊がいる。             (Meaning: There are sheep in the field.)
• 畑に虎がいる。             (Meaning: There are tigers in the field.)
• 畑に山羊がいる。           (Meaning: There are goats in the field.)
```
It must be emphasized that the Japanese text before the parentheses is the input information, and the meaning corresponding to the Japanese text is the output information. The "meaning" here is the meaning that exists in the brain rather than the English text. 

The English text in the subsequent parentheses is NOT the output information. These English texts are just to help us construct the corresponding meaning of the Japanese text in our brain.

The second step is to quickly glance at the English text in parentheses to get a general understanding of the meaning described in the English text. Then completely cover the English text, and then look at the Japanese text one by one with your eyes, and recall the meaning just described in the English text. Be careful not to recall the English text itself, but the meaning in your brain, or to be more precise, the scene or picture in your mind, such as a group of pigs moving in a field.

Note that every time you "look" at a line of Japanese text, you have to recall the meaning once. Although the meaning of each line is almost the same, this is a necessary step and cannot be omitted.

Here I mean "look" in the literal sense, or more precisely, look at the shapes of Japanese texts without trying to think about or understand them. Don't even worry about how they should be pronounced. This is to establish an association between the shape of Japanese text and its corresponding meaning. This association will stimulate the brain to automatically reshape the connections between nerve cells, and eventually form a structure that can process Japanese text. This is what we call the "reading ability" of a language.

Just repeat the above steps twice when you have time, do it two or three times at different times of the day, and you will see the effect the next day.

What is the effect?
